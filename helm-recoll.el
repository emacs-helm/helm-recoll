;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Helm interface for the recoll desktop search tool.

;;; Use:
;;
;; You need to create some helm-recoll sources before you can use them.
;; You can create sources using the `helm-recoll-create-source' function,
;; e.g. like this:
;;  (helm-recoll-create-source "docs" "~/.recoll/docs")
;;  (helm-recoll-create-source "progs" "~/.recoll/progs")
;;
;; Press C-c ? in the helm buffer to see information about how to query recoll

;; Then you can use the sources in helm like this:
;;   (helm :sources '(helm-source-recoll-docs helm-source-recoll-progs))

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Add code to your init (~/.emacs) file to create some sources (see above),
;; and then add a require statement for the library:
;;   (eval-when-compile (require 'helm-recoll nil t))

;;; Code:

(eval-when-compile
  (require 'cl-lib))
(require 'helm)
(require 'helm-files)

(defvar helm-recoll-options '("recoll" "-t" "-b")
  "A list where the `car' is the name of the recoll program followed by options.
You do not need to include the -c option since this is already included, and the
config directory can be passed as a argument to `helm-recoll-create-source'")

(defvar helm-recoll-sources-buffer "*helm recoll source select*")

(defvar helm-recoll-history nil
  "History of helm-recoll queries.")

** Helm Recoll Query Options

Enter one of the following options before your query to specify the query type:

-l      advanced search query (default, see next section)
-f      (exact) file name search query
-a      all words search query (matches if document contains all the words)
-o      any words search query (matches if document contains any of the words)

** Recoll Advanced Queries

Queries are sequences of terms with implicit AND and explicit OR and NOT (-)
logical operators. NOT gets priority over OR which gets priority over AND
(i.e. disjunctive normal form).

Terms can be either a word or double quoted phrase to search for in the
document, or a <FIELD>:<VALUE> pair as listed below. Wildcard (*/?/[]) and
anchor characters (^/$) can be used in words, phrases and field values, and
modifiers can be used for phrases (see below).

Example:

  ext:pdf -date:/2010 dir:local OR dir:share this OR that

is equivalent to

  ext:pdf AND (NOT date:/2010) AND (dir:local OR dir:share) AND (this OR that)

meaning search for

  pdf files BEFORE 2010 IN pathnames containing \"local\" or \"share\" with
  WORDS this or that IN

*** <FIELD>:<VALUE> pairs

title:      searching text in the document title or subject

author:     searching the documents originators

recipient:  searching the documents recipients

keyword:    searching document-specified keywords (few documents actually
							have any)
filename:   the document's file name

ext:        specifies the file name extension
            e.g.: ext:html

dir:        filtering on file location
            accepts negation, wildcards and tilde expansion; case sensitive

size:       filtering on file size
            use <,> or = and letters k/K, m/M, g/G, t/T as multipliers
            e.g (files between 100k and 1MB): size>100k size<1m

date:       for filtering on dates (but not times). General syntax is 2
            elements separated by a /. If either element is missing it is
            interpreted as the first/last date in the index. Each element can
            be a date in the form YYYY-MM-DD (the month or day may be missing)
            or a period in the form pNyNmNd where the N numbers are the
            respective numbers of years, months or days, any of which may be
            missing.
            e.g.:
            2001-03-01/p1y2m   the period covering 1 year and 2 months after
                                the 1st of March 2003
            2001/              from the beginning of 2001 up to now
            /2001              all dates up to 2001
            p2d/               from 2 days ago up to now

mime:       mime type
            values will be OR'ed by default except for negated terms which
            are AND'ed; you can use wildcards in the value (mime:text/*)
            e.g.: mime:application/* -mime:application/pdf

type:       category as defined in /usr/share/recoll/mimeconf
            (e.g. text/media/presentation/etc.).
            categories are OR'ed like mime types above, but can't be negated
            with -

*** Wildcards & Anchors

*           matches 0 or more characters
?           matches a single character
[]          match any character within the square brackets
^           match the beginning of the document text or field value
$           match the end of the document text or field value

Note: wildcards at the beginning of a word/phrase can slow recoll down a lot

*** Phrase Modifiers

Any of the following phrase modifiers may be placed at the end of a double
quoted phrase:

oN          allow upto N arbitrary words between words in phrase,
            e.g. ^\"test\"o5
            if N is not specified it defaults to 10
l           turn off stemming (mostly makes sense with p because stemming is
				      off by default for phrases)
p           turn default phrase search into a proximity one (unordered),
            e.g. \"order any in\"p
C           turn on case sensitivity
D           turn on diacritics sensitivity (if the index supports it)
